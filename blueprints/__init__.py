"""
Initialization file for the blueprints package.

This file makes the 'blueprints' directory a Python package.
It can also be used to import blueprints for easier registration in app.py,
but currently, app.py imports them directly.
"""

# This file can remain empty or be used to import blueprints later.
# Example (optional):
# from .ui_routes import ui_bp
# from .template_routes import template_bp
# from .processing_routes import processing_bp

# __all__ = ['ui_bp', 'template_bp', 'processing_bp']
